Changed
---
- `IMPORTANT` Significantly sped up the entire bot process by having the creation of the source screenshot in the /temp/ folder be tied to having Debug Mode being enabled. Previously, the bot always saved the source screenshot file and thus added about 500ms every single time it was called. As a result of this change, the bot is now going lightning fast. I did not have much time to fully test out how this change affects everything else, so please report any issues by opening up a GitHub issue and/or hop into the Discord server (link is in the README).
- Significantly overhauled how the bot chooses which training to run.
- Mood recovery logic will now take into account available dates as well (Tazuna and Riko).
- Better compatibility with non-1080p devices.
- Optimized process of determining number of skill points.
- Various minor changes and optimizations.

Fixed
---
- Fixed matching functions not putting the bounding box precisely around the target location in test images.
